## ⚠️ Remaining Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

Only 2 warnings remain (these are intentional and won't break deployment):

1. **Footer.tsx & TeamMemberCard.tsx**: Using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`
   - **Why**: Team photos need standard img tags for circular display
   - **Status**: Disabled with `eslint-disable-next-line` comments
   - **Impact**: None - images load perfectly
